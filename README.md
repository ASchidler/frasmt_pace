# HtdSMT - An SMT based solver for hyper tree decompositions

This is a solver for the HTD problem. It is an adapted version of the FraSMT solver (https://github.com/daajoe/frasmt)

The solver is written in Python 2 and requires the optimathsat solver (http://optimathsat.disi.unitn.it/).

To start it either call "python frasmt.py <Filename>" or pass the instance via STDIN to "python frasmt.py"
